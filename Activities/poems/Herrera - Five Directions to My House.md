"Five Directions to My House"
Juan Felipe Herrera


1. Go back to the grain yellow hills where the broken speak of elegance
2. Walk up to the canvas door, the short bed stretched against the clouds
3. Beneath the earth, an ant writes with the grace of a governor
4. Blow, blow Red Tail Hawk, your hidden sleeveâ€”your desert secrets
5. You are there, almost, without a name, without a body, go now
6. I said five, said five like a guitar says six.
