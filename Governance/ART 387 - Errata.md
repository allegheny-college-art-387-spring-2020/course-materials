# ART 387: Impossible Architecture Errata

This document contains a summary of all agreements made about course procedures including (but not limited to) rules pertaining to the "Green Monster."

## "Green Monster" errata

### Scale

For purposes of this course, relative or realistic scale is irrelevant unless otherwise noted.

### Trade/negotiation

#### Materials "borrowing"

"Borrowing" (see the [Materials Schedule](https://github.com/allegheny-college-art-387-spring-2020/course-materials/blob/master/Governance/ART%20387%20-%20Materials%20Schedule.pdf)) may not be done in the following circumstances:

* In anticipation of a project (i.e. only during assignments, not before)
* On behalf of their full group without group approval

"Borrowing" does not carry over from assignment to assignment. Unused "borrowed" levels expire at the assignment due date if not exercised.

#### Site exchange

Student may negotiate and trade selected sites after all sites for a project have been chosen. To trade sites:

* Students must inform the professor of the trade
* Students must not barter materials outside of the purview of the class (e.g. no monetary exchange)

### Cardinal directions

For the purposes of this course, when referencing cardinal directions for the course building board, we take "north" to mean the direction facing the exit sign at the end of the second floor atrium hallway. Additioanl cardinal directions derive from this understanding.

### Time, space, gravity, spacetime

If a building falls over of its own accord (i.e. due to gravitational pull on the structure), it may not be repaired unless otherwise noted.
